## Brass Metal Identification using Deep Learning

### Problem Statement
Identifying Brass Metal versus Non-Brass Metal is a pivotal task in materials classification, employing Deep Learning for binary classification. The affirmative class denotes instances where the material is Brass Metal, while the negative class indicates instances where the material is a different non-brass metal. 

This approach leverages advanced computational techniques to discern distinctive features and patterns, contributing to accurate and efficient identification. The utilization of Deep Learning ensures robust differentiation, facilitating applications in various industries requiring precise material classification.

## Solution Proposed 
The challenge at hand involves the binary classification task of distinguishing between Brass Metal and Non-Brass Metal, a crucial endeavor in materials classification. To address this, a Deep Learning approach, specifically utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has been proposed. The affirmative class signifies instances where the material is Brass Metal, while the negative class encapsulates instances where the material is a different non-brass metal.
